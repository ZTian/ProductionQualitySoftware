PROGRAMMING SAFETY:
-getStopwatches should return a defensive copy of stopwatchList. Returning stopwatches is actually returning a pointer to the original list, which can be dangerous.
-the Timer class and the constructor is public, there might be problems with hashCode and equals.

OVERALL:
-the implementation is basically thread safe.
-code is readable with necessary javadocs explaining each method.
