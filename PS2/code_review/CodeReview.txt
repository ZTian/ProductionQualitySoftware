ABILITY TO ADD, REMOVE, SEARCH FOR CONTACTS:
.Can search contacts by attribute. Maintaining Map<String,List<Address> > helps search contact by one of its attribute. Maybe the address book can be more convenient to support search by multiple attributes.
.Return contacts in List<Address>. Guarantees that all possible contacts with target information is returned.
.Users can access contacts through getter.

ABILITY TO SAVE/READ CONTENTS FROM A FILE:
.Structuring the address book into JSON. Guarantees that there is no value null to the String "null".

GOOD CODING PRACTICES:
.Some javadocs are excessive.
.It may be useful to use Builder pattern to consruct Contact the optional arguments.
.It may be unreasonable to initialize all entries in the Address to null.
.The name of each contact should be checked if it is null. It is not reasonable to add null String to a name. Blank spaces should also be forbidden. Name of contacts should follow some rules instead of adding in AddressBook arbitrarily.
.Maybe it is better to name the function getTotalSortedAddresses(), instead of getTotalAddressesSorted(). The method getTotalAddressesSorted suggests returning the whole AddressBook.

STYLE:
.Package on top of the file.
.Spaces instead of tabs.
.Good style.
